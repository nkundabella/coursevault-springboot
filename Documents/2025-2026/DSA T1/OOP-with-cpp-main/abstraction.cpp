Abstraction: is all about hiding unnecessary details and showing only essentials things
As we use abstract keyword in java to define abstract functions in c++ we use virtual functions
let us dive deep and see how they work

example of an abstract function

virtual void functionName() = 0;
=0; means the function has no name it should be defined by the subclass
