In this codes we are going to examine encapsulation concept

Encapsulation: is a pillar of OOP which is all 
about hiding internal details of an object and 
controlling access to its data
*/

To reach on this we use two main methods which are: 
=> Using access modifiers like: 

a) Private: This property or method defined with this modifier 
			can't be accessed outside the class
b) Public: This property  or method defined with this 
			modifier can be accessed everywhere in the codes
c) Protected: This property or method defined with this modifier
			 can only be accessed in the child class 

=> Using getters and setters
